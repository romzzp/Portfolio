# Description

This is my first attempt to make a portfolio using HTML and CSS.
This portfolio contains a navigation bar and an image on mine. this portfolio also contains the websites linked to the image that leads to the more information about the subject. Lastly it contains the contact info that leads to the linkedin and github page.
